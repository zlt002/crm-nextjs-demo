# Project Brief

## Executive Summary

Claude Code PM is a project management workflow system designed specifically for AI-assisted software development. It transforms how teams leverage AI by providing a structured, parallel execution framework that ensures quality while dramatically accelerating development velocity.

## What It Does

Claude Code PM implements a disciplined, 5-phase development workflow that turns product requirements into shipped code with complete traceability:

1. **Brainstorm** - Guided sessions to create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents
2. **Document** - Detailed specifications that leave no room for misinterpretation
3. **Plan** - Technical architecture with explicit decisions and dependency mapping
4. **Execute** - Parallel AI agents implement components simultaneously
5. **Track** - Transparent progress reporting through GitHub integration

## Why It Exists

### The Problem
AI-assisted development today operates in isolation:
- Developers use AI privately, creating knowledge silos
- "Vibe coding" leads to inconsistent architecture
- Context evaporates between sessions
- No traceability from requirements to implementation
- Teams can't collaborate effectively with AI

### The Solution
Claude Code PM creates a collaboration protocol where:
- **Humans and AI work together** on the same GitHub issues
- **Every line of code** traces back to written specifications
- **Multiple AI agents** work in parallel on different components
- **Progress is transparent** to the entire team
- **Context persists** across development sessions

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Workflow Management**: Complete PRD-to-code lifecycle
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **GitHub Integration**: Native issue and project management
- **Context System**: Project knowledge base maintenance
- **Agent Framework**: Specialized sub-agents for different tasks
- **Installation System**: Cross-platform setup utilities

### Out of Scope
- **Code Generation**: The agents coordinate work but don't replace developers
- **Project Hosting**: Works with existing GitHub repositories
- **Team Management**: Integrates with existing team structures
- **CI/CD Integration**: Focuses on development, not deployment
- **Enterprise Features**: Single-team focus (multi-org coming later)

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Eliminate Vibe Coding**: Enforce spec-driven development discipline
2. **Maximize Parallel Execution**: Enable 5-8 parallel tasks vs 1
3. **Preserve Context**: Reduce context switching by 89%
4. **Ensure Traceability**: Complete audit trail from PRD to production
5. **Enable Team Collaboration**: Humans and AI working together

### Success Metrics
- **Velocity**: 3x faster feature delivery
- **Quality**: 75% reduction in bug rates
- **Efficiency**: 89% less time lost to context switching
- **Adoption**: Teams using system consistently
- **Satisfaction**: Developer happiness with workflow

## Target Audience

### Primary
- **Development teams** already using Claude Code
- **Teams of 2-10 developers** needing structure
- **Projects with moderate to high complexity**
- **Organizations valuing quality and speed**

### Secondary
- **Solo developers** building substantial projects
- **Development agencies** managing client work
- **Open source projects** accepting AI contributions

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Cross-platform**: Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No Runtime Dependencies**: Pure shell scripts and markdown
- **GitHub Native**: Uses standard GitHub API and features
- **Claude Code Integration**: Leverages built-in capabilities

### Business Constraints
- **Simple Installation**: One-line setup process
- **No Lock-in**: Uses existing infrastructure
- **Affordable**: Minimal additional cost beyond Claude Code
- **Immediate Value**: Benefits from first use

## Key Features

### 1. Project Management Commands (`/pm:*`)
- `/pm:prd-new` - Create product requirements through brainstorming
- `/pm:prd-parse` - Convert to technical implementation plan
- `/pm:epic-oneshot` - Decompose and sync to GitHub
- `/pm:issue-start` - Execute with parallel agents
- `/pm:status` - Monitor overall progress

### 2. Context Management (`/context:*`)
- `/context:create` - Establish project knowledge base
- `/context:prime` - Load context for new sessions
- `/context:update` - Keep documentation current

### 3. Agent System
- **code-analyzer** - Bug hunting and code review
- **file-analyzer** - Summarize verbose outputs
- **test-runner** - Execute tests with clean reporting
- **parallel-worker** - Coordinate multiple agents

### 4. Integration Features
- **GitHub Sync** - Bidirectional synchronization
- **Worktree Support** - Isolated parallel development
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time status updates
- **Comment Updates** - Natural audit trail

## Differentiation

### From Traditional PM Tools
- **AI-Native**: Designed specifically for AI-assisted development
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple simultaneous work streams
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains knowledge across sessions
- **Developer-Focused**: Built by developers for developers

### From Other AI Tools
- **No Lock-in**: Uses standard GitHub infrastructure
- **Team Collaboration**: Humans and AI work together
- **Complete Workflow**: From idea to production
- **Structured Process**: Disciplined approach ensures quality

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GitHub API Changes**: Abstract API access for future flexibility
- **Claude Code Evolution**: Maintain compatibility through updates
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize for minimal overhead

### Adoption Risks
- **Workflow Resistance**: Provide clear ROI and gradual adoption
- **Complexity Perception**: Simple onboarding and documentation
- **Team Buy-in**: Demonstrate value through pilot projects

## Success Criteria

### Project Success
- Teams report 3x faster development
- 75% reduction in production bugs
- High user satisfaction scores
- Active community and contributions
- Integration with standard tools

### Technical Success
- Reliable performance across platforms
