# Product Context

## Problem Statement

### Development Team Challenges
Modern software development teams face persistent challenges:
- **Context evaporation** between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Parallel work creates conflicts** when multiple developers touch the same code
- **Requirements drift** as verbal decisions override written specs
- **Progress becomes invisible** until the very end
- **AI-assisted development operates in silos**, disconnected from team workflows

### Market Gap
Existing project management tools don't address AI-assisted development specifically:
- Traditional PM tools (Jira, Asana) lack AI integration
- AI tools operate in isolation from team collaboration
- No system for tracing AI-generated code back to requirements
- Missing workflow for human-AI collaboration on the same codebase

## Target Users

### Primary Users
1. **Development Teams Using Claude Code**
   - Teams already paying for Claude Code
   - Want to maximize ROI through better workflows
   - Need to scale AI assistance across team

2. **Solo Developers with AI**
   - Individual developers using AI assistants
   - Need structure for AI-assisted projects
   - Want to maintain quality while moving fast

3. **Technical Project Managers**
   - Managing AI-assisted development
   - Need visibility into AI-generated work
   - Responsible for delivery timelines

4. **Startup CTOs/Founders**
   - Building products with AI assistance
   - Need to move fast without sacrificing quality
   - Limited team size requiring maximum efficiency

### Secondary Users
1. **Development Agencies**
   - Managing multiple client projects
   - Need consistent workflows across projects
   - Want to showcase AI capabilities to clients

2. **Open Source Maintainers**
   - Managing contributions from AI and humans
   - Need clear documentation of decisions
   - Want to scale contribution handling

## Core Features

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Workflow
- **PRD Creation** (`/pm:prd-new`): Guided brainstorming sessions
- **Implementation Planning** (`/pm:prd-parse`): Technical specifications
- **Task Decomposition** (`/pm:epic-decompose`): Breakdown into actionable items
- **GitHub Synchronization** (`/pm:epic-sync`): Team visibility
- **Parallel Execution** (`/pm:issue-start`): Multiple AI agents working simultaneously

### 2. Context Management System
- **Project Documentation** (`/context:create`): Comprehensive knowledge base
- **Context Priming** (`/context:prime`): Fast agent onboarding
- **Progress Tracking** (`/context:update`): Living documentation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic identification of architectural patterns

### 3. Parallel Agent Framework
- **Specialized Agents**: Each optimized for specific task types
- **Context Preservation**: Main thread stays clean and strategic
- **Worktree Isolation**: Conflict-free parallel development
- **Progress Consolidation**: Single status view of all work streams

### 4. GitHub-Native Integration
- **Issues as Database**: Single source of truth
- **Comment-Driven Updates**: Natural audit trail
- **Label Organization**: Automatic categorization
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Clear task hierarchy

## User Personas

### 1. Alex - Tech Lead at Startup
**Background**: Leading 5-person team building SaaS product
**Goals**:
- Ship features 3x faster
- Maintain code quality with AI assistance
- Keep everyone aligned on requirements

**Pain Points**:
- Constant context switching between features
- AI-generated code doesn't match architecture
- Team members duplicate work

**How CCPM Helps**:
- Spec-driven workflow ensures alignment
- Parallel execution prevents duplication
- Context preservation reduces switching costs

### 2. Sam - Solo Indie Developer
**Background**: Building MVP alone using AI assistance
**Goals**:
- Move fast without breaking things
- Maintain project structure as it grows
- Ship MVP before funding runs out

**Pain Points**:
- "Vibe coding" leads to messy architecture
- Loses context between sessions
- No one to review AI-generated code

**How CCPM Helps**:
- 5-phase discipline prevents messy code
- Context system maintains memory
- GitHub integration provides audit trail

### 3. Jordan - Project Manager
**Background**: Managing team using Claude Code
**Goals**:
- Track progress of AI-assisted work
- Ensure requirements are met
- Coordinate human-AI collaboration

**Pain Points**:
- No visibility into what AI is doing
- Requirements get lost in translation
- Can't plan timelines for AI work

**How CCPM Helps**:
- GitHub issues provide visibility
- Complete traceability from PRD to code
- Predictable parallel execution

## Use Cases

### 1. Feature Development
**Scenario**: Team building new user authentication system
**Workflow**:
1. `/pm:prd-new auth-system` - Create comprehensive PRD
2. `/pm:prd-parse auth-system` - Technical implementation plan
3. `/pm:epic-oneshot auth-system` - Decompose and sync to GitHub
4. `/pm:issue-start 1234` - Execute with parallel agents
5. `/pm:status` - Monitor progress across all tasks

**Benefits**:
- All team members see same requirements
- Multiple components built simultaneously
- Complete audit trail of decisions

### 2. Bug Fixing
**Scenario**: Critical production bug needs immediate fix
**Workflow**:
1. Create issue directly in GitHub
2. `/pm:issue-start 5678` - Spawn agents to fix
3. Agents work in parallel: reproduce, diagnose, fix, test
4. `/pm:issue-sync 5678` - Update progress
5. Merge fix when all agents complete

**Benefits**:
- Fast parallel diagnosis and fixing
- Progress visible to whole team
- Proper testing included in fix

### 3. Refactoring
**Scenario**: Large-scale codebase refactoring
**Workflow**:
1. `/pm:prd-new refactor-architecture` - Plan refactoring
2. Decompose into independent modules
3. Each module refactored in parallel
4. Continuous integration testing
5. Gradual merge with confidence

**Benefits**:
- No downtime during refactoring
- Independent modules can be refactored simultaneously
- Risk minimized through isolation

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Development Velocity**: 3x faster feature delivery
- **Bug Reduction**: 75% decrease in production bugs
- **Context Switching**: 89% reduction in time lost
- **Parallel Tasks**: 5-8 tasks vs 1 previously

### Qualitative Outcomes
- **Team Alignment**: Everyone works from same specifications
- **Code Quality**: Consistent architecture and patterns
- **Transparency**: Full visibility into all work
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from idea to production

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
