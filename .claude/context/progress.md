# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Project**: Claude Code PM - A project management workflow system for AI-assisted development
**Phase**: Active Development / Distribution
**Repository Status**: Fresh clone from main repository
**Working Directory**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

## Recent Activity

- **Cloned repository** from main CCPM distribution
- **Initialized context system** with `/context:create` command
- **Created CLAUDE.md** with project-specific guidance
- **Set up project structure** with all necessary directories

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete PM System Setup**
   - Run `/pm:init` to install GitHub CLI and configure authentication
   - Install gh-sub-issue extension for proper issue relationships
   - Create required directories in `.claude/`

2. **Configure Project Integration**
   - Add project-specific details to context files
   - Set up testing framework integration with `/testing:prime`
   - Create initial project documentation

3. **Start First Workflow**
   - Create a sample PRD with `/pm:prd-new`
   - Walk through the 5-phase process
   - Demonstrate parallel execution capabilities

## Current Branch

Working on default branch (main/master) - no active development branches.

## Outstanding Tasks

- [ ] Install and configure GitHub CLI dependencies
- [ ] Set up authentication with GitHub
- [ ] Install gh-sub-issue extension
- [ ] Create .gitignore entries for `.claude/epics/` and `.claude/prds/`
- [ ] Initialize first epic to demonstrate workflow

## Progress Metrics

- **Context Files Created**: 1/9 (README.md exists, need to create 8 more)
- **System Readiness**: 25% (basic structure in place, need PM setup)
- **Documentation**: Complete (README.md, AGENTS.md, COMMANDS.md present)

## Notes

This is a fresh installation of the Claude Code PM system. The repository contains the framework and commands but has not yet been configured for active use with a GitHub repository. The next steps involve setting up the GitHub integration and creating the first project epic to demonstrate the workflow.
