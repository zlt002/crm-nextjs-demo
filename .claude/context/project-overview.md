# Project Overview

## Introduction

Claude Code PM is a revolutionary project management workflow system designed specifically for AI-assisted software development. It transforms how development teams leverage AI by providing a structured framework that combines the speed of parallel AI execution with the discipline of spec-driven development.

## High-Level Summary

At its core, Claude Code PM solves the fundamental challenge of modern AI-assisted development: **how to scale AI assistance across teams without sacrificing quality, collaboration, or traceability**. The system achieves this through:

- **Spec-Driven Workflow**: Every feature starts with comprehensive requirements
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple AI agents work simultaneously on different components
- **GitHub Native**: Uses issues as the single source of truth
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains project knowledge across sessions
- **Team Collaboration**: Humans and AI work together transparently

## Current State

The project is in active development with:
- âœ… Core workflow implementation complete
- âœ… Agent framework operational
- âœ… GitHub integration functional
- âœ… Installation system deployed
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimization in progress
- ðŸ”„ Additional agent types being developed
- ðŸ”„ Enterprise features planned

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Project Management Commands
- **PRD Creation** (`/pm:prd-new`): Guided brainstorming for comprehensive requirements
- **Implementation Planning** (`/pm:prd-parse`): Technical specifications and architecture
- **Task Management** (`/pm:epic-*`): Decomposition, synchronization, and tracking
- **Issue Execution** (`/pm:issue-*`): Parallel agent-based implementation
- **Progress Monitoring** (`/pm:status`, `/pm:next`): Real-time dashboards and prioritization

### 2. Context Management System
- **Knowledge Base Creation** (`/context:create`): Comprehensive project documentation
- **Session Priming** (`/context:prime`): Instant agent onboarding
- **Progress Tracking** (`/context:update`): Living documentation maintenance
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic architectural pattern identification

### 3. Parallel Agent Framework
- **Specialized Agents**: Each optimized for specific tasks
  - `code-analyzer`: Bug hunting and code review
  - `file-analyzer`: Verbose file summarization
  - `test-runner`: Test execution and analysis
  - `parallel-worker`: Multi-agent coordination
- **Context Preservation**: 80-90% reduction in verbose output
- **Worktree Isolation**: Conflict-free parallel development

### 4. GitHub Integration
- **Issues as Database**: Single source of truth
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Keep local and GitHub in sync
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Clear task hierarchy with gh-sub-issue
- **Comment Updates**: Natural audit trail
- **Label Organization**: Automatic categorization

## System Architecture

### Component Overview
```
User Interface (Slash Commands)
    â†“
Command Interpreter
    â†“
Task Dispatcher â†’ Agent Framework
                    â†“
              GitHub Integration
                    â†“
               Git Worktrees
```

### Data Flow
1. **Command Input**: User initiates with slash command
2. **Validation**: System checks prerequisites
3. **Agent Spawning**: Task-specific agents created
4. **Parallel Execution**: Agents work independently
5. **Result Consolidation**: Summaries returned to main thread
6. **GitHub Sync**: Updates pushed to team visibility

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Markdown-based**: All commands and configurations in human-readable format
- **Agent Isolation**: Each agent operates independently
- **Local-First**: Most operations work offline
- **GitHub Native**: Leverages existing team infrastructure
- **Context Optimized**: Designed to preserve conversation context

## Integration Points

### With Claude Code
- Native integration with Claude Code features
- Uses Task tool for agent spawning
- Leverages standard tool set
- No extensions or plugins required

### With GitHub
- Standard REST API integration
- Uses gh CLI for authentication
- Compatible with public/private repos
- Works with GitHub Projects (optional)

### With Development Workflows
- Fits into existing Git workflows
- Complementary to CI/CD pipelines
- Compatible with code review processes
- Enhances rather than replaces existing tools

## User Experience

### Getting Started
1. **One-line installation**: `curl -sSL ... | bash`
2. **System initialization**: `/pm:init`
3. **Project setup**: `/context:create`
4. **First feature**: `/pm:prd-new feature-name`

### Daily Workflow
1. **Session start**: `/context:prime`
2. **Check status**: `/pm:status`
3. **Work on tasks**: `/pm:issue-start 1234`
4. **Sync progress**: `/pm:issue-sync 1234`
5. **End session**: `/context:update`

### Key Interactions
- **Concise Output**: Agents return summaries, not raw data
- **Clear Progress**: Always know what's happening
- **Error Guidance**: Helpful messages for resolution
- **Consistent Patterns**: Predictable command structure

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed Improvements
- **5-8x** parallel task execution
- **89%** reduction in context switching
- **75%** fewer bugs due to detailed specifications
- **3x** faster feature delivery

### Scalability
